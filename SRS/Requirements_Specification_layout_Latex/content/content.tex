\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}

\section{Purpose }
The purpose of this document is to describe the Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) of the proposed application (Tutor-Hub). This will be the 1st release of this app. The application consists of two main parts, the web application and the backend server. Application architecture design, scopes, functions and its integration with existing systems at application designs are the core elements to be described in this document. This document provides a complete understanding of what is to be expected from the application. Clear understanding of the application and its functionalities will allow for the correct software to be developed for the end users. It can be used for future development of the application. This document provides the foundation for the design, construction, and testing of the application.

\section{Intended Audience}
The SRS described in this document is to be used by the group members and course instructor for developing the application. The group members will use the SRS to fully understand the expectations and requirements needed in the application. They will be able to use this SRS as a reference to see if the group members are constructing the application as per expectations.

This document is intended for developers (group members), instructor and TA of the course. The modification and maintenance of the app will be done by the team members. The team members and faculty will have access to this SRS.

\section{Intended Use}
This document will be used to develop a web-based tutor finder app where tutors and students will be able to find their intended tuition/tutor. The development team will use this SRS document as the basis for their entire project. Every person involved in development will follow the framework of this document to ensure requirements are fulfilled. Developers (group members) will use this document to understand the requirements of users and how they will use and interact with the system to be developed in order to perform their activities. The specification for software to be developed, which include functionalities, non-functional requirements, and software architecture can be found in this document. 
Group members along with the instructor will use this document to systematically plan the functional and security testing strategy of the application. Group members will also use the SRS to design the use case flow structure and content to show how the application can be used in the most effective way. It has to be delivered as end-user manual and technical documentations that covers all the requirement aspects proposed. Furthermore, the document will be used to minimize development time and cost.
\section{Product Scope}
Manual tuition quest is an old process in today's world of technology. The Tutor Hub web application will provide a new way of seeking suitable tutors for students as well as suitable jobs for the tutors. 
The main benefits of this web application will be:
      
\begin{enumerate}
\item The web application will be interactive and create job sectors for the tutors.   
\item The design will be simple so that minimal educated users can use them easily.
\item The tutors/ tuition's will be recommended by the nearby or selected location of the user. 
\item  A student will be able to see the main information like expected salary, preferable classes of the tutors. This will save time as they will be viewing the keywords only in the homepage and can compare this information with other tutors' information.
\item The tutor can form a batch for a specific subject and can upload online materials in that platform.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Risk Definition}
\begin{enumerate}
\item       There are chances that the requirements won't be fulfilled.
\item       We can face some problems in the unit testing.
\item       We also can face problems while implementing AI.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Constraints}
\textbf{Hardware Constraints:} Some of the users of this system will not have high-end computers with which to access this module. Therefore, we must take into account processing and internet speed limitations when designing the system. 

\textbf{Software Constraints:} The \textbf{“Tutor-Hub”} system shall be compatible with the most used multi platform web browsers, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome , Safari, Opera Mini, Microsoft Edge  and many more. Since this is a web app system, thus it doesn't have any operating system constraints. For Development purpose There may be purchased components, components reused from another application, or components being developed for subsystems outside of the scope of this SRS, but in order to interact this software application must have :-

\begin{enumerate}
\item Any operating system but Windows and Linux operating systems is preferred .
\item The software should be connected to a web server which runs 24x7.
\item The user accessing/developing the system from any computer must have an internet connection with all browsing capabilities.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Communication Constraints:} Below is a list of communication devices or protocols with which the product must interact.For example:-

\begin{enumerate}
\item System must be able to communicate with the printer in order to print documents.
\item System must communicate through TCP/IP port.
\item System is limited to HTTP/HTTPS Protocols only.
\end{enumerate}

.\textbf{Interface with System Constraints:} This system will have to utilise other functions within the existing system, and thus we will be constrained by any existing limits of this system. Possibility of Lack of reference on existing systems.GUI is available only in English.

\textbf{Design and Implementation Constraints:} Some of the design and implementation constraints identified are listed below: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Students are allowed to register for more than one course.
\item  Students don't have the authority to edit or access data in the system.
\item  This system supports distributed databases such as Sqlite3.
\item This system may only allow booking but does not include online payment methods. 
\end{enumerate}


\section{Assumptions}
It is assumed that the system follows the Asian localized standard for the course organization.The requirements shall change if the \textbf{“Tutor-Hub”} system is intended to be universal, and any user can belong to a s intended to be universal, and any user can belong to a different organization with their particular database system.

It is assumed that students/tutors data will be made available for the project in some phase of its completion. Until that, test data will be used for providing the demo for the presentations.It is assumed that the students and parents are familiar with applications that find themselves easier .

\begin{enumerate}
\item The users have sufficient knowledge of computers.
\item The remote computer should have Internet connection and Internet server capabilities.
\item The users know the English language, as the user interface will be provided in English
\item This system will not be violating any internet ethnic or cultural rules and won’t be blocked by any Telecom companies.
\end{enumerate}
